# 👋 Hey there, I'm AJAY!

**Software Developer | Terminal Tinkerer | AI Explorer | Slightly Overcaffeinated**

### 🧠 About Me

- 🔧 I build with Python, Flask, Django, FastAPI, and occasionally duct tape.
- 🤖 Currently diving into Machine Learning projects — starting with **ASL Detection**.
- 🧰 Backend dev at heart, but I won't panic when front-end hits me.
- 🧑‍💻 I prefer code that works *and* makes sense (clean > clever).
- 🛰 I self-host things... because why not?
- 🧪 Always learning: From C programming to MongoDB, one terminal session at a time.
